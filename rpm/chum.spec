%description
The package sailfishos-chum is a helper RPM, which solely provides an
appropriate local repository configuration for utilising the SailfishOS:Chum
community repository with command line tools as pkcon or zypper.

Note that the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application provides the same local
repository configuration, while also providing a GUI app, which can be used in
addition to pkcon or zypper. Furthermore it offers easy switching between the
regular SailfishOS:Chum repository and the SailfishOS:Chum testing repository.
Hence you might rather install the sailfishos-chum-gui RPM instead of the
sailfishos-chum RPM.

The package sailfishos-chum-testing is a helper RPM, which solely provides an
appropriate local repository configuration for utilising the SailfishOS:Chum
TESTING repository with command line tools as pkcon or zypper.
Note that the SailfishOS:Chum testing repository is primarily aimed at
software developers.

Also note that the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application provides the same local
repository configuration, while also providing a GUI app, which can be used in
addition to pkcon or zypper. Furthermore it offers easy switching between the
regular SailfishOS:Chum repository and the SailfishOS:Chum testing repository.

# BTW, `ssu`, `rm -f`, `mkdir -p` etc. *always* return with "0" ("success"), hence
# no appended `|| true` needed to satisfy `set -e` for failing commands outside of
# flow control directives (if, while, until etc.).  Furthermore on Fedora Docs it
# is indicated that solely the final exit status of a whole scriptlet is crucial:
