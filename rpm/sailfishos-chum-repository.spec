%description
The package sailfishos-chum is a helper RPM, which solely provides an
appropriate local repository configuration for utilising the SailfishOS:Chum
community repository with command line tools as pkcon or zypper.

Note that the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application provides the same local
repository configuration, while also providing a GUI app, which can be used in
addition to pkcon or zypper.  Furthermore it offers easy switching between the
regular SailfishOS:Chum repository and the SailfishOS:Chum:Testing repository.
Hence you might rather install the sailfishos-chum-gui RPM (e.g., via the
sailfishos-chum-gui-installer RPM), instead of the sailfishos-chum RPM.

The package sailfishos-chum-testing is a helper RPM, which solely provides an
appropriate local repository configuration for utilising the 
SailfishOS:Chum:Testing repository with command line tools as pkcon or zypper.
Note that the SailfishOS:Chum:Testing repository is primarily aimed at
software developers.

Also note that the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application provides the same local
repository configuration, while also providing a GUI app, which can be used in
addition to pkcon or zypper.  Furthermore it offers easy switching between the
regular SailfishOS:Chum repository and the SailfishOS:Chum:Testing repository.

# BTW, `ssu`, `rm -f`, `mkdir -p` etc. *always* return with "0" ("success"), hence
# no appended `|| true` needed to satisfy `set -e` for failing commands outside of
# flow control directives (if, while, until etc.).  Furthermore on Fedora Docs it
# is indicated that solely the final exit status of a whole scriptlet is crucial: 
# See https://docs.pagure.org/packaging-guidelines/Packaging%3AScriptlets.html
# or https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Scriptlets/#_syntax
# committed on 18 February 2019 by tibbs ( https://pagure.io/user/tibbs ) in
# https://pagure.io/packaging-committee/c/8d0cec97aedc9b34658d004e3a28123f36404324
# Hence I have the impression, that only the main section of a spec file is
# interpreted in a shell called with the option `-e', but not the scriptlets
# (`%%pre*`, `%%post*`, `%%trigger*` and `%%file*`).
